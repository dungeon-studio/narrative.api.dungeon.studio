	  Adventurer, this town is suffering from the loss of many.  The
	  villagers believe many of their friends and family have been taken by
	  Deniz Setan, devils of the sea.  The must have been taken to one of
	  the nearby islands.  There is a strange glow at night as if a large
	  group is camped there.

	  If you would aid us in this search we would be forever indebted for
	  the return of our missing.  If you come across these Deniz Setan I'd
	  ask that you not harm them but instead determine their motives.

	  The church believes all endeavours should aim for peace and while we
	  mourn our losses we cannot abide a violent end to this unfortunate
	  happening.  Please speak with my scribe, Hayley Yewenbow, to hear the
	  church's terms of payment for return of our friends.
